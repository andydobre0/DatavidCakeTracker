# DatavidCakeTracker
## you can access the app here:
## caketrackerapp.azurewebsites.net
**the app has one admin user that can add members by the required fieds (admin credentials are sent on email)**
**as a user that can see other members birthdays, you have to register with First name and Last name, the email is computed automatically with @datavid.com domain**
**i haven't yet configured mail verification**
**apparently i don't have any free db plans on azure so this db is limited to 9gb storage and 2 v-cores**

## when clicking "View Members" as a user, you will see the members info while as an admin you will be able to add/delete members
**there might be some test members there :D**
